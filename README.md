# React Native Super Cluster
This module wraps [AirBnB's react-native-maps](https://github.com/airbnb/react-native-maps) and uses [MapBox's SuperCluster](https://github.com/mapbox/supercluster) as clustering engine.

## Rationale
This module wants to provide a stable and performing solution for maps clustering in React Native. In particular, our efforts are focused on integrating SuperCluster methods into React's state/lifecycle events, ensuring stability, compatibility and great performance.

## Install
`npm i --save react-native-maps-super-cluster`
